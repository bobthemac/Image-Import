# Image Importer
Designed as an alternative to using the EOS utility from Canon which requires the camera to be connected. This program imports from removable media like SD or Compact Flash cards and puts the files into dated folders in the location of the users choosing.

# Folder Naming
Currently folders are named with a date in the format of YYYY_MM_DD as it matches the format that was used by the EOS utility. I may add the ability to change the naming in the future but currently I don't think it is necessary.

# TODO
Currently the application isn't the most robust or optimized I plan to improve the error handling and make errors less likely. I also plan to optimize the code as it currently isn't the fastest and some aspects can be improved. Finally some functions are quite long and could do with some refactoring to make them neater and potentially help increase performance also.
